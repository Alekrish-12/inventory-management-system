## Backend Setup

1. Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine.
2. Configure MongoDB connection in `backend/server.js`.
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

The frontend should open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
