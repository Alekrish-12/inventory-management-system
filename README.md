  - Express
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - Axios (for API calls)
- **Other Tools**:
  - Git & GitHub (for version control)
  - Postman (for testing APIs)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd inventory-management-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies for the backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   cd backend     # Navigate to backend directory
   npm install    # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../frontend # Navigate to frontend directory
   npm install    # Install frontend dependencies


## Backend Setup

1. Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine.
2. Configure MongoDB connection in `backend/server.js`.
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.



## Frontend Setup

1. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

The frontend should open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.



## Usage

- Use the frontend interface (`http://localhost:3000`) to interact with the inventory management system.
- Perform CRUD operations on products, manage stock levels, view reports, etc.

## Contributing

- Fork the repository
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature`)
